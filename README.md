# FunWithCrimeData
 
This application was created for a way to expirment with the material UI component set.

The data that I had available for building a database was moc wrapsheet data.  That data 
had to first be parsed to create the database.

## View Crimes by Type
This view provides a list of crime types.  Selecting a crime type provides a list of the charge
details.

Since the rapsheets provide demographic information it was decided to allow the user to
filter by demographic information.

## View Top 10 offenders
This view provides a list with descending crime count.

## View Map View
This view maps the offenders to pushpins on google maps.
